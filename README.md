The Horiseon company requested that there codebase follow accessibility standards and use semantic HTML elements so that their website could be optimized for search engines.

Current codebase has generic container < div > .

Will remove <div> element and replace it with different containers that will help website be up to accessability standards.
Comments in codebase will show what changes were made.
Using HTML for this request.
