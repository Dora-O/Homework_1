#Horiseon Project

The Horiseon company requested that there codebase follow accessibility standards so that their website could be optimized for search engines.
Client wants people with disabilities to be able to access the website without running into issues.

Current codebase has generic container <div>.
Will remove <div> element and replace it with different containers that will help website be up to accessability standards.
Comments in codebase will show what changes were made.
